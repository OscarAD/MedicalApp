A common task for all medical offices is that of scheduling appointments. You will build an application to handle all the tasks associated with secheduling. It is best to build the program in steps, because there's a lot to do! Each user interface must be attractive, easy to use and understand, and impervious to runtime errors. Use menus and toolbars that will permit later expansion of the program. In this first assignment, you will focus on collecting and saving data. Each assignment builds on your solution program from the previous assignment. Of course, if you do not complete an assignment, you will find it difficult to begin the next one! But the same will be true when you are employed after college.
Part 1: Collect Patient Information: Build a user interface that collects information about a patient. Create a Patient class containing the following data: ID, first name, last name, date of birth, phone, email, insurance provider (if any), type of plan (HMO/PPO), subscriber ID, and plan ID. The patient's ID must be unique.

Part 2: Create a Patient List: Store the Patient objects in a List and serialize the list to an XML file.

Part 3: Create a Physician List: Create a Physician class containing ID (unique), first name, last name, and specialty. Create an enumerated type containing the following medical specialties: Family, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, and Orthopedics. Add 5 physicians to a List and serialize the list to an XML file.

After completing all three parts, turn in a ZIP file containing your VB project. All XML data files must be locted in the project's home directory.
